# sevestralMobileApp

This is a game I worked on for some time intending to release as an app. It utilizes the LibGDX game engine as well as Gradle. It's programmed in Java. Some files have been omitted due to too many things for me to redact, but APK's are included that should still work. All of the characters and monsters I hold copyrights for, but otherwise it's Apache licensed so I don't care what happens with it.

Worked on while I was in college in my free time from 2014 to 2015.
