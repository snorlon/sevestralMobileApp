				Abstracted to be mostly just strength + position + morale
			Each town has a defense force based on population and military buildings in town
				Possibly aggression as well (default for town0
				Estimated prior to attacking, randomly updates every turn as "new intel"
				
		Faction attack system
			One faction per planet
				Each faction has its own interests determined by the leader
					Randomly decided at start of the game
			Player starting planet has non-diety faction ditched possibly?
			Incoming/Outgoing attacks visible in command system
			Takes several turns for attacks depending on map distance between them
		
		Notification system
			Shows incoming attacks and priority issues with towns
				Ex: Diety approaching, town at risk of being freed
				Ex: Faction approaching with army in X turns
				
	Log events
		Town coming/leaving under player ownership

	Bugs:
		Not healing on mobile after battles 
			Found with diety battle
		Occasional mismatch between current location and where you are moving to
			Results in sometimes entering current town instead of moving, or entering current battle instead of moving
		Diety can go out of bounds (y of 0)
		
Next:
	Map difficulty determined with starting location
		Algorithm
			Each map has a level from 1 to 300
				scales more in new game+ or with the higher game difficulties
					Function call given the difficulty
						Flag for override resetting priors (in the event of fresh data)
						Iterates across all locations to reset their level to 0
						Then iterates again to start assigning levels
			One starting spot per town that you are expected to start your planet journey at
				Lower levels concentrated there
					Once lower levels allocated, pick another town from each location to distribute levels too
						Once that territory is fully allocated, repeat
							Continue until all maps have a level assigned
		Store level in savefile
